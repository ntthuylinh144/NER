2.1 General safety notes
SIL 3 acc. to IEC 62061 / PL e / Cat. 4 acc. to ISO 13849‑1
The 3SK11 safety relays and SIRIUS 3RQ12 force-guided coupling relays are designed in such a
way as to allow implementation of applications up to SIL 3 acc. to IEC 62061 and PL e / Cat. 4 acc.
to ISO 13849-1.
SIL 2 acc. to IEC 62061 / PL c / Cat. 2 according to ISO 13849‑1 for 3RQ10 coupling relay
The 3RQ10 force-guided safety-related coupling relays are designed in such a way as to allow
implementation of applications up to SIL 2 acc. to IEC 62061, PL c / Cat. 2 acc. to ISO 13849-1.
Hazardous voltage.
Can cause death, serious injury, or property damage.
Hazardous electrical voltage can cause electric shock, burns, and damage to property.
• Turn off and lock out all power supplying the system and device before working on the
device.
• To ensure protection against the hazard of electric shock when the terminal cover is open,
screw in all clamping screws that are not needed to clamp conductors.
• Close the terminal covers and always keep them closed during operation.
Loss of safety functions.
3SK1, 3RQ1 output expansions and 3RM1 Failsafe motor starters that are connected to a 3SK2
safety relay via 3ZY12 device connectors are supplied with voltage via the device connectors.
Do not directly connect any separate supply voltage to an output expansion 3SK1 (A1/A2),
3RQ1 (A1/A2), or to a 3RM1 Failsafe (A1/A2) motor starter, as otherwise the safety function will
be bypassed.
Safe state
The basis of the safety function is the definition of the safe state. In the case of safety relays, this
is the "OFF state", i.e. an open contact for sensors or shutdown of the actuators.
Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 23
Hazardous voltage. Can cause death or serious injury
To ensure touch protection and degree of protection IP20, screw in all screws which are not
used for conductor clamping and close the terminal covers.
Protection against electrically conductive contamination!
The devices must be protected against conductive contamination while taking account of the
ambient conditions. One way you can do this is to install the devices in a control cabinet with
the appropriate degree of protection.
You will find more information in the IEC 60529 standard, "Degrees of protection provided by
enclosures (IP Code)" and in the "Technical specifications (Page 129)" section.
Loss of safety function when adjusting slide switch on 3SK1 output expansions.
• Use one of the optionally available cover sealings to protect the slide switch of the 3SK1
output expansion against unauthorized and unintentional adjustment.
Safe functional extra-low voltage
The 3SK1 safety relays, SIRIUS 3RQ1 force-guided coupling relays, and 3RM1 Failsafe motor
starters with a supply voltage of 24 V DC must be operated with safe functional extra-low
voltage (SELV, PELV). This means these modules must only be subjected to a voltage of Um even
in the event of a fault. The following applies for these 3SK1 safety relays: U < 60.0 V.
m
You will find more detailed information about safe functional extra-low voltage in the data
sheets of the power supplies to be used.
Material damage caused by electrostatic charging
When handling and installing 3SK1 safety relays, SIRIUS 3RQ1 force-guided coupling relays,
and 3RM1 Failsafe motor starters, ensure that the components are protected from being
electrostatically charged. Changes to the system configuration and wiring are only permissible
while the supply voltage is switched off.
Connection of 3SK1 safety relays is only permissible when the power supply units (PELV and
SELV) are switched off.
24 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
Noise immunity/grounding
The following must be grounded in accordance with the regulations to ensure immunity of the
3SK1 safety relays, SIRIUS 3RQ1 force-guided coupling relays, and 3RM1 Failsafe motor starters
with 24 V DC supply voltage:
• PELV / SELV power supply units
(please also note the documentation for the respective power supply unit in this regard).

Safety systems - General information
4.1 What is safety?
Safety defines a state in which the risk of damage is reduced to a tolerable level, or which can be
regarded as risk-free. Following on from this definition, functional safety concerns persons,
machines and the environment.
The objective of safety systems is to reduce the risk for humans and machines that is posed
by a use case to an acceptable level. The first step is, therefore, to identify the risk of a
use case. In order to make a reliable assessment regarding the application, each individual
function of a machine or plant must be analyzed for potential hazards.
For further information, refer to the brochure "Safety of machines and plants" which is
available here as a download: Functional safety (http://www.siemens.com/safety).
Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 33
4.2 Safety function
A safety function describes the reaction of a machine/plant when a specific event occurs (e.g.
opening of a protective door). Execution of the safety function(s) is carried out by a safety-
related control system. This usually comprises three subsystems, detecting, evaluating and
reacting.
Detecting (sensors):
• Detecting a safety requirement,
e.g.: EMERGENCY STOP or a sensor for monitoring a hazardous area (light array, laser
scanner, etc.) is operated.
Evaluating (safety relay):
• Detecting a safety requirement and safely initiating the reaction (e.g. switching off the safety-
related outputs).
• Monitoring the correct operation of sensors and actuators.
• Initiating a reaction upon detection of faults.
Reacting (actuators):
• Switching off the hazard by means of downstream actuators.

4.3 Basic terminology
4.3.1 Redundancy/single-channel and two-channel
Redundancy
With redundancy, more than one component is implemented for the same function, so a faulty
function of a component is performed instead by the other component(s).
A redundant configuration reduces the probability of a function failing due to a single
defective component. This requirement is essential for achieving SILCL 3 in accordance
with IEC 62061, SIL 3 in accordance with IEC 61508 and PL e (Cat. 4) in accordance with
ISO 13849-1 (also necessary for SIL 2 / PL d under certain circumstances).
The simplest form of redundancy is two-channel redundancy.
If a circuit fails, two-channel redundancy or appropriate wiring ensures that the safety
function is maintained.
In a redundant system configuration, the subsystems for detecting and reacting must also be
implemented with two-channel redundancy.
All SIRIUS Safety devices that comply with SILCL 3 in accordance with IEC 62061, SIL 3 in
accordance with IEC 61508 and PL e (Cat. 4) in accordance with DIN EN ISO 13849-1 are
redundantly configured with regard to the internal logic as well as with regard to the output
circuits.

*= positively-driven auxiliary contacts/mirror contacts
4.3.2 Cross-circuit detection
Cross-circuit detection is a diagnostic function of a safety relay that detects short-circuits and
cross-circuits between the input channels (sensor circuits) during two-channel sensing or
reading. A cross-circuit can be caused, for example, by a cable casing being squashed. In devices
without cross-circuit detection, this can mean that a two-channel EMERGENCY STOP circuit does
not trip even though only one NC contact is faulty (secondary error).
With 3SK1 devices, a cross-circuit is detected in the sensor circuits by means of signals with
different clock pulses. If the clocked signals overlap, the device detects a cross-circuit. With
3SK1 basic units, cross-circuit detection can be deactivated to allow electronic sensors to be
evaluated (that monitor themselves as well as the cable to the evaluation unit).
4.3.3 Enabling circuit (safety-related output)
An enabling circuit provides a safety-related output signal. From an external viewpoint, enabling
circuits usually act as NO contacts (however, in terms of functionality, safety-oriented opening
is always the most important aspect).
An individual enabling circuit that is redundantly configured internally in the safety relay can
be used for SIL 3 / PL e.
Note: Enabling current paths can also be used for signaling purposes.
3SK1 safety relays are only equipped with enabling circuits with NO functionality. This means
that when the safety function is triggered, or a fault is detected, the enabling circuits will
always transfer to the safe state (NO contact open).
4.3.4 Signaling circuit
A current signaling path provides a safety-related output signal.
36 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
With 3SK1 relays, the signaling circuits are always implemented as NC circuits. This means
that when the safety function is triggered, or a fault is detected, the signaling circuits will
close.
With 3SK1 semiconductor devices, the signaling circuits are always implemented as NO
circuits. This means that when the safety function is triggered, or a fault is detected, the
signaling circuits will open.
4.3.5 Feedback circuit
A feedback circuit is used to monitor controlled actuators (e.g. relays or load contactors) with
force-guided contacts or mirror contacts. The safety-related outputs can only be activated if the
feedback circuit is closed.
When 3SK1 output expansions are used on 3ZY12 device connectors with 3SK1 Advanced basic
units, it is not necessary to incorporate the expansion modules in the feedback circuit wiring.
This is implemented internally via the device connector.
Ensuring electrical safety and safety function
The normally closed contact of 3RQ12. is designed for a voltage of 24 V DC. If higher voltages
occur, electrical safety cannot be ensured due to the voltage clearance distances. If the 3RQ12.
is integrated in a system with a device connector, the feedback circuit is routed via the device
connector. Connection of external voltage is not necessary and not permitted. Connecting
external voltage can bypass the safety function.
4.3.6 Stop category
Stop category 0
Non-controlled shutdown by immediately switching off the power to the machine's drive
elements.
Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 37
Stop category 1
Controlled stopping where the energy feed is interrupted with a time delay, or is only interrupted
once standstill has been reached.
Time-delayed shutdown of safety-related outputs in accordance with Stop category 1 is not
ensured under all operating states.
In the case of some internal device faults, and when disconnecting the supply voltage, these
safety-related outputs are switched off instantaneously .
4.3.7 Automatic start
For an automatic start, the device is started without manual confirmation, but only after the
input image has been checked and a positive test of the safety relay has been conducted. This
function is also known as dynamic operation and is not permissible for EMERGENCY STOP
devices. Safety devices for prohibited danger zones (e.g. position switches, light arrays, safety
shutdown mats) can use the automatic start function if this does not pose any risk.
An automatic start is not permitted for EMERGENCY STOP devices.
4.3.8 Manual start
For a manual start, the device is started by operating the START button, but only after the input
image has been checked and a positive test of the safety relay has been conducted. On a manual
start, the START button is not monitored for correct operation, a positive edge of the START
button is sufficient for starting.
Manual start is not permitted for EMERGENCY STOP devices.

38 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
4.3.9 Monitored start
For a monitored start, the device is started by operating the START button, but only after the
input image has been checked and a positive test of the safety relay has been conducted.
Contrary to the manual start, the monitored start evaluates a signal change of the
START button. This means that the START button cannot be bypassed (misuse). For PL e
(ISO 13849-1) as well as SIL 3 (IEC 62061), the monitored start must be used in the case
of EMERGENCY STOP. For other safety sensors/functions, the necessity for a monitored start
command depends on the risk assessment.
If the START button is operated for more than 2 seconds, the 3SK1 basic unit detects a wiring
short-circuit in the START button and switches to the fault state (Device = green; SF = flashing
red; Out = flashing yellow; IN = off)
In the delivery state of the 3SK1 safety relays, the start type is set to "Monitored start".

4.3.10 Two-hand operation/synchronism
Synchronous sensor operation is a special form of simultaneity of sensors.
In this case, it is not sufficient for sensor contacts 1 and 2 to be switched to the closed state
"at any different times". Instead, they must be closed within 0.5 seconds.
Synchronism of sensors is required, in particular, in the case of two-hand operation of
presses. This ensures that the presses only become active when the sensors are operated
simultaneously with both hands. This minimizes the risk of the operator getting a hand in the
press.
When 3SK1 safety relays are used, you can achieve applications up to type IIIc in compliance
with EN 574 / EN 13851 (applications up to PL e/Cat. 4 in compliance with EN 13849-1 or
SILCL 3 in compliance with IEC 62061).
In the delivery state of 3SK1 safety relays, monitoring of time synchronism is deactivated.
Monitoring of time synchronism can be activated using the following adjustable parameters for
3SK112 Advanced and 3SK122 Advanced:
• Jumper T1/PAR (NO/NC evaluation)
• DIP switches (1) Autostart
• DIP switches (3) 2 x single-channel
Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 39
The 3SK1 Advanced safety relays exclusively support two-hand control units with 2 NO contacts.
The two-hand circuit must be marked in compliance with EN 574 EN 13851. You can find
information on determining the response time in the section entitled Response times
(Page 119).
4.3.11 Cascading
Cascading of safety relays is used for tripping safety relays in series.
Several safety functions can then be logically connected to a shared shutdown path. Several
safety-related outputs can be created for selective shutdown of drive elements.
The connection between the individual modules must be arranged on one side only, because
cascading from the last relay to the first one would create a loop which would prevent
starting.
Cascading is implemented within a control cabinet in a single-channel configuration; this is
even permissible with SIL 3 / PL e, because cable routing within a control cabinet is protected
against short-circuits and short-circuiting to P potential (fault exclusion in accordance with
ISO 13849-2).
The 3SK1 Advanced device series offers an extremely convenient solution for cascading.
Input expansions can be easily connected to the evaluation unit by means of device
connectors.
4.3.12 Startup testing
The sensor or protection equipment must be opened and closed again after the supply voltage
is restored before the enables for the 3SK1 safety relay can be switched through.
Startup testing ensures that any errors in the sensors are detected (again), because safety
relays lose their ability to store errors at zero voltage.
Unauthorized manipulation of the protection equipment can also be detected through
startup testing.
The plant operator decides whether startup testing should be performed (risk assessment).
No general statements apply.
In the delivery state of 3SK1 safety relays, startup testing is deactivated.
40 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
4.3.13 Connection of actuators
To achieve the Performance Level / Safety Integrity Level given in the following examples, the
actuators shown must be monitored in the feedback circuit of the corresponding safety relay.
For capacitive and inductive loads, we recommend an adequate protective circuit. In this way,
electromagnetic interference can be suppressed and contact service life increased.

4.3.15 Use of magnetically operated switches
If magnetically operated switches are used, the magnetic contacts may weld on account of
capacitive effects. The reason for this is that a high peak current may occur when switching these
loads (e.g. also cable capacitances). A corresponding fuse protection with the rated current of
the magnetically operated switch must be provided if the device/sensor combinations have not
been explicitly enabled.
For more details, please refer to the documentation of the magnetically operated switch.

5.1 3RQ1 output expansion
5.1.1 Applications
Expansion of safety-related outputs
The 3RQ1 output expansions are used to expand the safety-related outputs. The maximum
achievable Performance Level PL/Cat. in accordance with ISO 13849-1, SILCL in accordance with
IEC 62061, SIL in accordance with IEC 61508 is SIL 2 / PL; for 3RQ12. is SIL 3 / PL e. To achieve this,
you must realize the external wiring, i.e. the connection between the basic unit and 3RQ1
output expansion, in a fail-safe manner, e.g. with the 3ZY12 device connector.
With the 3RQ10., SIL 2 in accordance with IEC 62061 can only be achieved by means of
additional feedback circuit wiring of the 3RQ1 normally closed contact in the safety circuit of the
3SK1 basic unit.
The 3RQ12. output expansions are certified up to SIL 3 / PL e in accordance with IEC 62061 /
ISO 13849. With these variants, the feedback circuit is situated on the device connector, that
is to say, additional wiring of the feedback circuit is not necessary.
If expansion units are controlled via the 3ZY12 device connector, additional feeding of the
control supply voltage (A1/A2) at one of the output expansions leads to a fault in the system
configuration.
Using the output expansions with conventional wiring
If you require Stop category 1 outputs for the output expansion, terminals A1/A2 of the output
expansion must be connected to outputs 38 or 48 on 3SK1 basic units with relay outputs or to
Q1t/Q2t (in the case of 3SK1 with semiconductor outputs).
Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 47
Control
You can control the output expansions via the supply voltage (A1/A2).
Alternatively, with the 24 V AC/DC variant, you can control the output expansion via the
3ZY12 device connector.
If the expansion units are controlled via the 3ZY12 device connector, additional feeding of
the control supply voltage (A1/A2) at one of the output expansions leads to a fault in the
system configuration.
5.1.2 Function description
The operating state of the 3RQ1 output expansions is displayed on the DEVICE LED.
Depending on the variant used, the 3RQ1 output expansions have 1NO/1NC, 2NO/1NC,
2NO/2NC or 4NO/1NC. The output expansions can be controlled via any output of the basic
unit via (A1). The NC circuits of the 3RQ1 are used to monitor the output expansion or for
additional switching.
In the 24 V DC variants, the expansion units can be controlled and evaluated via the 3ZY12
device connectors.

Use of device connectors
• A device connector is always necessary when other devices have to be plugged in.
• A device termination connector is always required in the system for the last module on the
right.
Use of the device connectors to expand the Advanced basic units is optional.
The device connectors cannot be used with the Standard series.
Only safety relays with a supply voltage of 24 V DC may be used on the 3ZY12 device connectors.

If a basic unit is expanded on the right, the last output expansion must be terminated with a
device termination connector of the corresponding device.
If a basic unit is only expanded on the left, a device termination connector for 3SK1 safety relays
must be mounted below the basic unit.
6.1.2 Applications
The 3SK1 Advanced basic unit can be expanded on the input and output sides using 3ZY12
device connectors (connecting plugs) without any additional wiring outlay. When configuring
the system, it is important to ensure that input expansions are connected on the left and 3RQ1
force-guided coupling relays/3RM1 Failsafe motor starters on the right of a basic unit.
56 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
6.2 System configuration rules
General information
• All basic units can be operated as a stand-alone device without a device connector.
Expansion on the input side
• If an (additional) input expansion is detected on the left when the basic device or an input
expansion powers up, it will be loaded into the device configuration.
• An input expansion evaluates the sensor states and generates an enable signal for the basic
unit depending on the start condition. The enable signal is then acquired by an input
expansion on the right-hand side, or acquired by the basic unit and ANDed with its sensor
statuses.
You can find information on the start characteristics in the system configuration of the 3SK1
Advanced in the chapter "Explanation of the device’s function (Page 115)".
• The 3ZY12 device connector used below the final device must be fitted with a cover on the
left side (included with the device termination connectors).
• A 3SK1230 power supply can also be used in the 3SK system. This 3SK1230 power supply
must always be plugged into the system on the extreme left.
• No more than one 3SK1230 power supply is admissible for each system.
• If a 3SK1230 power supply is used, no additional, external 24 V DC voltage is permitted to be
connected to a basic unit.
Output expansion
• If an output expansion is detected on the right when the device powers up, this will be loaded
into the device configuration. The internal feedback circuit of the contact extension is
evaluated and checked.
• If both the 3SK1211 / 3RQ1 output expansion and 3RM1 Failsafe motor starters are used in
a system, the 3RM1 Failsafe motor starters must be positioned on the right of the 3SK1211 /
3RQ1 output expansions.
• If a 3SK1213 output expansion is used in the system, this must always be the final station in
the system (on the right) and must be fitted with a 3ZY1212-0FA01 device termination
connector. Only one 3SK1213 output expansion can be used in the system with a device
connector; further 3SK1213 output expansions can be optionally interfaced by wiring.
• On the 3SK121 output expansions, a slide switch on the device front must be used to set
whether the (UNDELAYED) or (DELAYED) output signal of the basic unit is to trigger a
response. If a purely instantaneous 3SK112 basic unit is used, the slide switch MUST be set
to the (UNDELAYED) position.
The 3RQ1 output expansions do not have a slide switch and always react to the (UNDELAYED)
output signal.
• In the case of a change to the device configuration during operation, error mode is activated
immediately. Restarting must be triggered via Power OFF/ON.
Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 57
• If output expansions are used, a device termination connector for the 3SK1 safety relay must
ALWAYS be used under the final device on the right (for 3SK1211) with the switch setting: "1"
(switch in top position), device termination connector set for 3SK1 safety relay, > 45 mm
wide (for 3SK1213) or device termination connectors for 3RM1 motor starters must be used
• 22.5 mm device termination connector for 3SK1 / 3RQ1:
(cid:18)
① Below 3SK1211 output expansion: The switch of the device termination connector must be
closed, i.e. in position 1 at the top
② Below basic unit: The switch of the device termination connector must be open, i.e. in position
2 at the bottom.
• No switch needs to be set on the device termination connector for 3RM1 motor starters
• As from certain load limits/temperature ranges, clearances must be observed for 3RM1
Failsafe motor starters. To this end, there are appropriate device connectors for looping
through signals (3ZY1212-2AB00).
• In the configuration with a 3SK1 Advanced basic unit on a 3ZY12 device connector, 3RM1
Failsafe motor starters can only be controlled by the instantaneous enable signal of the 3SK1
unit. If control of the 3RM1 Failsafe motor starters by means of the time-delayed output is
desired, this can only be done by wiring the time-delayed safety-related output of the 3SK1
basic unit.
You will find further information on the configuration guidelines for 3RM1 Failsafe motor
starters in the SIRIUS 3RM1 motor starters (http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/
view/en/66295730) manual, in the chapter "Load feeders - protection against short circuit".

58 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
Supply voltage must only be fed in on the basic unit
The supply voltage of 24 V DC must only be fed in on the basic unit, otherwise the safety
function is bypassed.
Power supply by means of the 3SK1230 power supply
• When device connectors are used, only one 3SK1230 power supply is permitted in each
system.
• The 3SK1230 power supply must always be located on the extreme left.
• If a 3SK1230 power supply is used, an additional (external) 24 V DC connection is not
permitted (this also applies to the cascading input, as well as to non-floating sensors).
24 V DC supply voltage from an external power supply unit
• It is only permitted to connect a voltage of 24 V DC to the terminals on the basic unit.
• It is not permitted to supply 24 V DC to an expansion component or 3RM1 Failsafe motor
starter.

8.2.5 Wiring rules for spring-loaded terminal (push-in system)
Notes on handling spring-loaded terminals (push‑in system)
The terminal area of the spring-loaded (push-in) terminals is rectangular, and the maximum
overall dimensions of the conductor to be wired must not exceed 1.5 x 2.4 mm (control current
terminals).
Attention must be paid to the orientation of the terminal area, which may call for vertical
fitting of rectangularly crimped cables.
To make optimum use of available terminal area, you are advised to choose a form of
crimping that creates a corresponding rectangular contour. Trapezoidal crimping is generally
very highly suitable in this case.
When use is made of a cable that utilizes the full overall height, the terminal's spring is
deflected to the maximum. Therefore, removal of this cable may become a problem because
it requires further deflection of the spring.

8.4 Device replacement
When replacing a device, you do not need to re-wire it. The terminals can be disconnected
from the defective device and then connected to the new device.
You can provide the terminals with coding pins. These are to help you avoid errors when
replacing the terminals (see the chapter "Terminal coding (Page 62)" for more details).
Replacing the module

After applying the supply voltage, the new 3SK1 basic unit checks whether the hardware
configuration matches the device configuration.
If there are no deviations, the system re-enters safety mode.

Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 113
9.1 Procedure for configuration
General information:
• It is only possible to change the configuration (DIP switch, NC/NO evaluation, potentiometer,
input and output expansion) in configuration mode. Modifications during operation are not
accepted.
• A configuration change (DIP switch, NC/NO evaluation, potentiometer) is indicated in safety
mode by the "DEVICE" LED flashing green/yellow, but does not change the device function.
• In safety mode, if a change in the system configuration (input and output expansion) is
detected, the device switches to error mode ("DEVICE" LED and "SF" LED red). A restart is only
possible using Power OFF/ON.
Procedure for configuring a basic unit
1. Set the configuration (DIP, PAR, potentiometer, input expansion, output expansion) in
accordance with the desired function.
2. Connect the power supply.
3. If the device detects a modified configuration, it remains in configuration mode (LEDs flash)
during power up.
4. Confirm the new configuration by operating the SET/RESET pushbutton for more than 1s.
5. The configuration has been accepted and the device changes to safety mode.
Configuration and setting the delay time
A change to the configuration must only ever be carried out when the system is disconnected
from the power.
In safety mode, an adjustment to the potentiometer does not result in a change to the
parameterized delay time.
A change to the potentiometer setting made during operation is not accepted and is indicated
in safety mode by a yellow/green flashing "DEVICE" LED. The device can be restarted by
performing a RESET (pressing the SET/RESET button) or by disconnecting and reconnecting the
supply voltage. Following a restart, the device remains in safety configuration mode during
power up (all safety-related outputs are shut down) until the new delay time is accepted by
pressing the SET/RESET button.
114 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
9.2 Explanation of the device's functions
Explanation of the device functions (DIP switches)
DIP Parameter Function
switch
1 Start type • Autostart: The safety-related outputs are switched to the active position as soon as the
switch-on condition is satisfied at the sensor inputs IN1, IN2, INF and INK. The START button
connecting terminal INS is not queried.
• Monitored start: The safety-related outputs are switched to the active position as soon as
the switch-on condition is met at the IN1, IN2, INF and INK sensor inputs and the START
button at the INS terminal is actuated (start with the falling edge).
2 Cross-circuit de‐ Cross-circuit detection is only possible with floating sensors. The sensors must be connected
tection between T1 - IN1 and T2 – IN2. At the terminals IN1 and PAR (if used), the test signal of terminal
T1 is expected; at the terminals IN2 and INF , the test signal of T2 is expected. The device detects
a sensor fault if the signal at the terminals IN1, PAR or IN2, INF does not match the test signals
T1, T2.
Cross-circuit detection must be deactivated if electronic sensors such as light arrays or laser
scanners are connected. The 3SK1 now no longer monitors the sensor inputs for cross-circuit
detection. Usually, the outputs of safety sensors (OSSD) are already monitored for cross-circuits
in the sensor.
Devices with PAR terminals expect the test signal T2 at the parameterization input. A 24 V signal
at the PAR or INF terminals results in a fault (cross-circuit at the input).
3 Type of connec‐ • 1 sensor with 2 contacts 1 x two-channel; NC/NC.
tion It is expected here that both contacts be open simultaneously.
With the additional connection of T1 to PAR, this DIP parameterization applies to ONE two-
channel sensor with NC/NO contacts.
• 2 sensors with one contact each 2 x single-channel; NC / NC.
In this case, both sensors are AND-connected. Simultaneity is not monitored.
4 Startup testing After a power failure, startup testing requires that the sensors at IN1 and IN2 are actuated once
by the system operator.
INK input for cascading
The INK cascading input is set up redundantly from the terminal in the device.
With protected installation, safety applications up to Performance Level e (PL e) or Safety
Integrity Level 3 (SIL 3) can be implemented.
This applies if the connected sensor or output is suitable.
Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 115
The INK cascading input can be used for the following applications:
• Safe connection of safety relays
In this application, a higher-level safety relay switches off the 3SK1 safety relay via the
cascading input via a safe output.
• Additional safety sensor circuit
The cascading input INK is AND-linked with the sensor inputs IN1 and IN2.
The cascading input can be connected to 1-channel safety sensors (forced opening). The
start function for the INK cascading input corresponds to the start response of sensor inputs
IN1 and IN2 (autostart or monitored start).
• Functional switching
The INK cascading input can also be used for normal switching duty (not safe).
When using a 3SK1 safety relay with instantaneous and time-delayed contacts, the two
following safety notes must always be observed:
In the event of external faults such as:
• Cross-circuit fault
• Short circuit to ground
• Current-source short circuit
and to access the configuration mode for copying a delay time after a reset, the following
device behavior must always be taken into account:
The outputs of stop category 0 switch instantaneously, while the outputs of stop category 1
have a time delay.
The sequence cannot be interrupted.
Exception: Switching off the power supply.
116 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
Saving the starting command:
1. If the safe state is restored during the time delay, (e.g. the protective door is closed) and the
START button is actuated, the safety-related outputs switch to the active position
immediately after the delay time has elapsed.
The actuation of the START button is saved.
The OFF-delayed enabling contacts or outputs of the 3SK112-CB4 safety relays (relay and
semiconductor outputs) cannot be retriggered. This means that if an OFF command in the
sensor circuit is canceled before the delay time has elapsed, the delay time still elapses in
full length. If a start command has been issued during this time or if autostart has been set,
after this time has elapsed the OFF-delayed enabling contacts switch off briefly and switch
on again immediately with the instantaneous enabling contacts (start command is saved).
2. If a sensor is actuated at an input expansion within the system configuration, the entire
system is disconnected. If the sensor at the input expansion is activated (e.g. protective door
is open) and the START button on the basic unit is actuated, this command will be saved by
the basic unit. This results in an automatic start of the system once the sensor at the input
expansion is reset (for example, a protective door is closed again). This system response is
identical in the system configuration for all 3SK1 basic units.
For additional notes/explanations on this topic, see the following FAQ (https://
support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/103655974)
Observe the following in the case of protective doors with tumblers:
If the voltage Us is disconnected on devices with time-delayed outputs between switching the
instantaneous outputs and the time-delayed outputs, the delay time expires when the voltage
Us is restored, and the time-delayed contacts change their switch positions.
Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 117
9.3 Modes
The 3SK1 safety relays have 4 main operating modes:
• Power-up
• Configuration mode
• Safety mode
• Error mode
Power-up
During start-up (up to 7 seconds), the 3SK1 safety relay runs through a complete function test.
Configuration mode
A saved configuration can only be modified in configuration mode.
The configuration must only ever be modified after disconnecting the power supply.
If the device detects a configuration change during the restart (DIP, PAR, potentiometer, input
expansion, output expansion), it does not change automatically to safety mode after power
up, but instead remains in configuration mode.
In configuration mode, those LEDs flash yellow whose ON DIP switch position is on the right;
all other parameter settings are not explicitly indicated.
The configuration is accepted by pressing the SET/RESET button for approximately 1 s.
In configuration mode, the device is in the safe state. No monitoring functions are active.
A configuration change made during operation is not accepted, and in safety mode, this is
indicated by a yellow/green flashing "DEVICE" LED. The device can be restarted by performing a
RESET (pressing the SET/RESET button) or by disconnecting and reconnecting the supply
voltage.
Safety mode (DEVICE LED: green)
In safety mode, all monitoring functions are active in accordance with the set configuration.
Parameterized startup testing is indicated by a green flashing "DEVICE" LED. Only when this has
been successfully executed does the "DEVICE" LED show a green light.
Error mode
Error mode is indicated by a red "DEVICE" LED or by a red "SF" LED. In error mode, the
device ALWAYS changes to the safe state.
118 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
9.4 Response times
Verification of response times in the case of safety circuits
When safety equipment is commissioned, steps must be taken to verify that a safety-related
output will switch off within a maximum permissible response time if the input signal changes
at the relevant input.
To provide this verification, you must determine the total response time of the application
you have configured.
Note that the calculation of the response time affects the level of safety and governs the overall
design of the system.
You can find the response data of the safety relays in the technical specifications of the
respective devices in the chapter "Technical data (Page 129)".
You can find the response data of the 3RM1 Failsafe motor starters
in the technical specifications in the "SIRIUS 3RM1 motor starters (http://
support.automation.siemens.com/WW/view/EN/ 66295730)" manual.
Calculation of the response times
To calculate the response times of the overall system configuration, you must add up the
individual response times of all input expansions affected by deactivation and also the response
time of the basic unit.
If output expansions are used, the response times of the relevant output module are also
added to the total time from the sensor to the actuator.
Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001 119
120 Equipment Manual, 10/2025, A5W02967072002A/RS-AA/001
Since commissioning of the 3SK1 safety relays is an important, safety-related step, it must be
carried out by qualified personnel.
Carry out function test of the plant.
To guarantee the safety of the system, a full functional test must be carried out and successfully
concluded following commissioning.
Commissioning 3SK1 safety relays
3SK1 safety relays are commissioned by applying the operating voltage.
After the supply voltage has been applied, all LEDs show a green light for about 1 s (lamp
test). The LEDs then go out for approx. 0.5 s. The device configuration is then displayed on
the configuration LEDs for approx. 3 s.
If no configuration change (DIP, PAR, potentiometer, input expansion, output expansion) has
been detected, the device changes automatically to safety mode and is ready for operation.
However, if the device detects a deviation of the set parameters from the saved
configuration, it remains in safe configuration mode until the new configuration is accepted
by pressing the SET/RESET button.
Observe the following during commissioning:
The cascading input must be bypassed (24 V DC) if it is not to be used.
Monitoring of the feedback circuits is not optional.
